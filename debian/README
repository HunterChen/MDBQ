The Debian Package libmdbq
----------------------------

mdbq is a job queue for C++ based on MongoDB as the center of communication.
It can be used standalone (the user inserts jobs and processes them). However,
and much more interestingly, MDBQ clients are compatible with the python
hyperopt package available on pypi, which allows to search large parameter
spaces efficiently for optimal parameters.
